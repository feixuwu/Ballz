# Ballz

This game is a teach project, is a copy of famous ballz. the project started before 3 years, when I begin to use unreal engine 4,
I want to show my friends how unreal engine can do on one or two days, I finished this game in two days alone.


This game have no cpp code, all code is blueprint, the game can run on PC, android and IOS. If you are a beginner and try to create
 a game all by blueprint, you can try read and debug this game, to know the power of UE4. if I can create this game in one or two days,
 then you can do it too, maybe next famous game is create by you.
